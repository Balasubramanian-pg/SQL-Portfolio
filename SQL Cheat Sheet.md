FROM orders;
```
ðŸ”¹ **Output:**  
| total_orders |
|-------------|
| 1500        |

ðŸ“Œ **Example 2: Count orders placed by a specific customer (`customer_id = 101`)**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS customer_orders
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 101;
```
ðŸ”¹ **Output:**  
| customer_orders |

  WHERE department_id IN (
      SELECT department_id
      FROM departments
      WHERE location = 'NY'
  );
  ```

---

## 3. Common Table Expressions (CTE)  
**Purpose:** Create a temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  WITH SalesCTE AS (
      SELECT salesperson, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
      FROM sales
      GROUP BY salesperson
  )
  SELECT *
  FROM SalesCTE
  WHERE total_sales > 10000;
  ```

---

## 4. Window Functions  
**Purpose:** Perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without collapsing the result set.

- **Example (Ranking Salaries):**

  CREATE INDEX idx_customer_name
  ON customers(customer_name);
  ```

---

## 7. Stored Procedures & Functions  
**Purpose:** Encapsulate a series of SQL statements for reuse. Procedures perform actions, while functions return a value.

- **Stored Procedure Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByDept (@dept_id INT)
  AS
  BEGIN
      SELECT employee_name, salary
      FROM employees
      WHERE department_id = @dept_id;

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trg_AfterInsert
  ON orders
  AFTER INSERT
  AS
  BEGIN
      PRINT 'A new order has been inserted.';
  END;
  ```

---

## 9. Transactions  
**Purpose:** Ensure a sequence of SQL statements are executed as a single unit, maintaining data integrity.

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
      UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
      UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
  COMMIT;
  ```

---

## 10. Set Operations  
**Purpose:** Combine results from multiple SELECT queries.

- **UNION** â€“ Combines results and removes duplicates.
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name FROM tableA
  UNION
  SELECT column_name FROM tableB;
  ```
- **INTERSECT** â€“ Returns only the common records.
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name FROM tableA
  INTERSECT
  SELECT column_name FROM tableB;
  ```

## 1. Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
**Purpose:** Query hierarchical or recursive data such as organizational charts or folder structures.

**Example (SQL Server / PostgreSQL):**
```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT employee_id, manager_id, employee_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, e.employee_name
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
```
*This recursive CTE starts with top-level employees and then recursively joins to retrieve all subordinate employees.*

---

## 2. Pivoting Data
**Purpose:** Transform row data into columns for a more intuitive summary or report.

**Example (SQL Server using PIVOT):**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT year, month, sales
    FROM SalesData
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT (
    SUM(sales)
    FOR month IN ([Jan], [Feb], [Mar])
) AS PivotTable;
```
*This query converts monthly sales rows into columns for January, February, and March.*

---

## 3. Dynamic SQL
**Purpose:** Build and execute SQL queries dynamically at runtime, which is useful when table names or conditions vary.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(4000);
DECLARE @TableName NVARCHAR(100) = 'Orders';
SET @sql = 'SELECT * FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@TableName);
EXEC sp_executesql @sql;
```
*This example constructs a SQL statement using a variable for the table name and executes it safely.*

---

## 4. Temporary Tables and Table Variables
**Purpose:** Store intermediate results temporarily during complex query processing.

**Example (Temporary Table in MySQL):**
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE TempSales (
    sale_id INT,
    sale_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO TempSales (sale_id, sale_amount) VALUES (1, 100.00);
SELECT * FROM TempSales;
```
*Temporary tables exist only for the duration of your session, allowing you to break down complex operations.*

---

## 5. JSON Functions
**Purpose:** Parse, query, and generate JSON data directly within your SQL queries.

**Example (MySQL):**
```sql
SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(json_column, '$.name') AS name
FROM json_table;
```
*This extracts the `name` field from a JSON column, making it easier to work with JSON data stored in your database.*

---

## 6. Spatial Data Functions
**Purpose:** Work with geographic and geometric data for applications like mapping or spatial analysis.

**Example (PostGIS for PostgreSQL):**
```sql

FROM spatial_table;
```
*This converts spatial geometry data into a human-readable text format.*

---

## 7. Query Hints and Optimization
**Purpose:** Influence the query optimizer's behavior to improve performance in specific scenarios.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Orders WITH (NOLOCK)
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01';
```
*The `NOLOCK` hint can help reduce locking contention by reading uncommitted data (use with caution).*

---

## 8. Grouping Sets, ROLLUP, and CUBE
**Purpose:** Perform multi-level aggregations to produce summary reports with subtotals and grand totals.

**Example (ROLLUP in MySQL):**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department WITH ROLLUP;
```
*This query returns a row for each department along with an extra row that shows the overall total count.*

---

Below is a further advanced SQL cheat sheet highlighting additional powerful SQL techniques and features:

---

## 9. Advanced Window Functions  
**Purpose:** Retrieve values from rows before or after the current row without collapsing the result set.

- **LEAD() and LAG()**  
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT
      employee_name,
      salary,
      LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS previous_salary,
      LEAD(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary
  FROM employees;
  ```
  *This returns the previous and next salary relative to each employee's salary.*

- **FIRST_VALUE() and LAST_VALUE()**  
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT
      employee_name,
      salary,
      FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_salary,
      LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS lowest_salary
  FROM employees;
  ```
  *These functions fetch the first and last values in a window, respectively.*

---

## 10. Full-Text Search  
**Purpose:** Perform efficient text searches on large text columns.

- **Example (SQL Server):**
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM articles
  WHERE CONTAINS(content, 'database');
  ```
  *This query searches for the term "database" within the `content` column.*

---

## 11. Table Partitioning  
**Purpose:** Divide large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve performance and maintenance.

- **Example (MySQL Range Partitioning):**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT,
      order_date DATE,
      amount DECIMAL(10,2)
  )
  PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(order_date)) (
      PARTITION p2019 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),
      PARTITION p2020 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),
      PARTITION p2021 VALUES LESS THAN (2022)
  );
  ```
  *This partitions the `orders` table by year, making queries on specific date ranges more efficient.*

---

## 12. Materialized Views  
**Purpose:** Store the result of a query physically to speed up retrieval for complex or resource-intensive queries.

- **Example (Oracle):**
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
  SELECT salesperson, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY salesperson;
  ```
  *Materialized views can be refreshed periodically to provide up-to-date aggregated data.*

---

## 13. Error Handling with TRY/CATCH  
**Purpose:** Capture and handle errors in SQL code, especially within stored procedures.

- **Example (SQL Server):**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRY
      -- Statements that might cause an error
      UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
  END TRY
  BEGIN CATCH
      PRINT 'An error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
  END CATCH;
  ```
  *This structure catches errors and provides a mechanism to handle them gracefully.*

---

## 14. Hierarchical Queries (Oracle CONNECT BY)  
**Purpose:** Retrieve and display hierarchical data (e.g., organizational structures).

- **Example (Oracle):**
  ```sql
  SELECT employee_id, employee_name, manager_id
  FROM employees
  START WITH manager_id IS NULL
  CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;
  ```
  *This query builds an organizational hierarchy starting from top-level employees (with no manager).*

---

## 15. Optimizing Index Usage and Maintenance  
**Purpose:** Enhance query performance by creating, analyzing, and maintaining indexes.

- **Creating a Composite Index:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_customer_order ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
  ```
  *A composite index can speed up queries filtering on both `customer_id` and `order_date`.*

- **Rebuilding an Index (SQL Server):**
  ```sql
  ALTER INDEX idx_customer_order ON orders REBUILD;
  ```
  *Regular index maintenance (like rebuilding) ensures optimal performance.*

---

Below are even more advanced SQL features to expand your toolkit:

---

## 16. MERGE / UPSERT  
**Purpose:** Combine insert, update, and delete operations in one atomic statement, which is useful for synchronizing tables.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
MERGE target_table AS target
USING source_table AS source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET target.value = source.value
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT (id, value) VALUES (source.id, source.value)
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN
    DELETE;
```
*This statement updates matching records, inserts new ones, and deletes records not present in the source.*

---

## 17. Cursors  
**Purpose:** Process query results row by row when set-based operations arenâ€™t suitable.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
DECLARE @value INT;

DECLARE cursor_example CURSOR FOR
SELECT column_name FROM table_name;

OPEN cursor_example;
FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_example INTO @value;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    -- Process each row individually
    PRINT @value;
    FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_example INTO @value;
END;

CLOSE cursor_example;
DEALLOCATE cursor_example;
```
*Use cursors sparingly, as set-based operations are typically more efficient.*

---

## 18. Batch Processing & Scripting  
**Purpose:** Execute multiple SQL statements as a single unit or batch.

**Example (T-SQL):**
```sql
-- This batch creates a temporary table, inserts data, and selects from it.
CREATE TABLE #TempData (id INT, value VARCHAR(50));

INSERT INTO #TempData (id, value)
VALUES (1, 'A'), (2, 'B');

SELECT * FROM #TempData;
GO  -- Marks the end of a batch in SQL Server.
```
*Batches can help organize scripts and control execution flow.*

---

## 19. Advanced Data Types  
**Purpose:** Leverage specialized types for complex data such as XML, arrays, or geospatial data.

- **XML:**  
  **Example (SQL Server):**
  ```sql
  DECLARE @xml XML = '<root><item id="1">Value</item></root>';
  SELECT @xml.value('(/root/item/@id)[1]', 'INT') AS ItemID;
  ```
  
- **Arrays (PostgreSQL):**  
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT ARRAY[1, 2, 3] AS numbers;
  ```

*Using these types can simplify the storage and querying of structured data.*

---

## 20. Security, Roles & Encryption  
**Purpose:** Manage access, permissions, and protect data within the database.

- **Roles & Permissions:**  
  **Example (PostgreSQL):**
  ```sql
  CREATE ROLE read_only;
  GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO read_only;
  ```
- **Encryption:**  
  Some databases offer built-in encryption features for data-at-rest or during transmission (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption in SQL Server).

*Properly managing security is critical for safeguarding data integrity and privacy.*

---

## 21. Query Execution Plans & Optimization Tools  
**Purpose:** Analyze and optimize query performance by reviewing how the database executes SQL statements.

- **EXPLAIN (MySQL/PostgreSQL):**
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
  ```
  *This provides insights into index usage, joins, and potential bottlenecks.*

- **Execution Plan Analysis (SQL Server):**
  ```sql
  SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON;
  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
  SET SHOWPLAN_ALL OFF;
  ```
*Understanding execution plans helps you fine-tune your queries for better performance.*

## 22. Temporal Tables (System-Versioned Tables)
**Purpose:** Automatically track and store the full history of data changes over time, enabling you to query data as it was at any point in time.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeHistory (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    ValidFrom DATETIME2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START,
    ValidTo DATETIME2 GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END,
    PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (ValidFrom, ValidTo)
)
WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.EmployeeHistoryHistory));
```

---

## 23. Graph Queries
**Purpose:** Model and query complex many-to-many relationships (such as social networks or recommendation systems) using node and edge tables.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
-- Create node table for persons
CREATE TABLE Person (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50)
) AS NODE;

-- Create edge table for friendships
CREATE TABLE Friendship (
    $from_id INT,
    $to_id INT
) AS EDGE;

-- Query to find a person's friends:
SELECT p.Name, f.$to_id
FROM Person p
JOIN Friendship f ON p.ID = f.$from_id;
```

---

## 24. External Tables / PolyBase
**Purpose:** Query data stored in external sources (like Hadoop, Azure Blob Storage, or flat files) as if it were in your local database.

**Example (SQL Server with PolyBase):**
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ExternalSales (
    SaleID INT,
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2)
)
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'externaldata/sales/',
    DATA_SOURCE = MyExternalDataSource,
    FILE_FORMAT = MyFileFormat
);
```

---

## 25. Row-Level Security
**Purpose:** Enforce fine-grained access control by restricting which rows a user can view or modify.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
-- Create a predicate function:
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_securitypredicate(@CustomerID INT)
RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
    RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_result
           WHERE @CustomerID = CAST(SESSION_CONTEXT(N'CustomerID') AS INT);

-- Apply the security policy on the Sales table:
CREATE SECURITY POLICY SalesFilter
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate(CustomerID)
ON dbo.Sales
WITH (STATE = ON);
```

---

## 26. Change Data Capture (CDC) / Change Tracking
**Purpose:** Track changes made to tables over time so you can capture data modifications for auditing or incremental data processing.

**Example (SQL Server CDC):**
```sql
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table 
    @source_schema = 'dbo', 
    @source_name   = 'Sales', 
    @role_name     = NULL;
```

---

## 27. Columnstore Indexes
**Purpose:** Improve the performance of analytical queries by storing data in a columnar format rather than row-based, which is particularly effective for large data warehouses.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
CREATE COLUMNSTORE INDEX idx_ColumnStore
ON Sales (SaleID, Amount);
```

---

## 28. In-Memory OLTP
**Purpose:** Dramatically boost transaction processing performance by storing and managing data in memory-optimized tables.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE InMemorySales (
    SaleID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED,
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2)
) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON, DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA);
```

---

## 29. Data Compression
**Purpose:** Reduce the storage footprint of your data and potentially improve I/O performance through row-level or page-level compression.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Sales 
REBUILD PARTITION = ALL 
WITH (DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE);
```

---

## 30. Extended Events
**Purpose:** Monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot performance and other issues in SQL Server by capturing detailed event data.

**Example (SQL Server):**
```sql
CREATE EVENT SESSION QueryMonitor ON SERVER 
ADD EVENT sqlserver.sql_statement_completed
ADD TARGET package0.event_file(SET filename = N'QueryMonitor.xel');
ALTER EVENT SESSION QueryMonitor ON SERVER STATE = START;
```

## 31. Database Replication and Mirroring  
**Purpose:**  
Enable high availability and redundancy by replicating data between databases. This helps ensure data remains accessible in case of hardware failures or planned maintenance.  

**Example (Conceptual - SQL Server):**  
Replication is often configured using SQL Server Management Studio and system stored procedures. For example, to set up snapshot replication, you might use:  
```sql
-- This is a conceptual example; actual replication setup involves several steps.
EXEC sp_addpublication 
    @publication = 'MySnapshotPublication', 
    @publication_type = 'snapshot',
    @description = 'Snapshot replication for high availability';
```
*Note: The full setup requires configuring publishers, distributors, and subscribers.*

---

## 32. Query Store and Plan Forcing  
**Purpose:**  
Capture historical query performance data to analyze and optimize queries. The Query Store also allows you to force a specific query plan if needed, helping mitigate performance regressions.  

**Example (SQL Server):**  
```sql
-- Enable Query Store on your database
ALTER DATABASE YourDatabase SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
```
After enabling, you can review performance data in SQL Server Management Studio and, if necessary, force an optimal plan using query hints (e.g., `OPTION (USE PLAN N'...')`).

---

## 33. Dynamic Data Masking  
**Purpose:**  
Protect sensitive information by masking it in query results without altering the underlying data. This is particularly useful for limiting exposure in non-privileged environments.  

**Example (SQL Server):**  
```sql
ALTER TABLE Customers
ALTER COLUMN Email ADD MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'email()');
```
*This masks the email addresses so that only a partial view is returned to users without proper privileges.*

---

## 34. Distributed Transactions and Two-Phase Commit  
**Purpose:**  
Ensure atomic operations across multiple databases or servers. Distributed transactions coordinate commits across systems so that either all operations succeed or none do.  

**Example:**  
```sql
BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION;
  -- Execute operations across different databases/servers
  UPDATE DatabaseA.dbo.Orders SET Status = 'Processed' WHERE OrderID = 123;
  UPDATE DatabaseB.dbo.Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - 1 WHERE ProductID = 456;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```
*Note: Distributed transactions require proper configuration of a transaction coordinator (e.g., MSDTC in SQL Server).*

---

## 35. Advanced Concurrency Control  
**Purpose:**  
Manage simultaneous data access using fine-tuned locking and isolation levels, reducing conflicts and improving performance in multi-user environments.  

**Example (SQL Server using SNAPSHOT isolation):**  
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  -- Perform concurrent-safe operations here
  UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
  UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```
*Using SNAPSHOT isolation minimizes locking contention by providing a transactionally consistent view of the data.*

Below are additional advanced SQL features (items 36â€“40) that further extend your capabilities for handling complex, scalable, and high-performance database scenarios:

---

## 36. Database Sharding  
**Purpose:**  
Distribute large datasets across multiple database servers (shards) to enable horizontal scaling and improve performance under heavy loads.

**Concept:**  
Sharding is typically managed by the application or middleware rather than pure SQL. The idea is to partition data based on a key (like customer ID) so that each shard holds a subset of data.

**Conceptual Example:**  
```sql
-- Data distribution is managed externally. For example:
-- Orders for Customer IDs 1-10000 go to Shard1, 10001-20000 to Shard2, etc.
INSERT INTO Orders_Shard_1 (order_id, customer_id, order_date, amount) VALUES (...);
```

---

## 37. Read Replicas  
**Purpose:**  
Improve read performance and reduce load on the primary database by offloading read operations to one or more replica databases.

**Concept:**  
Read replicas are typically configured in managed or cloud environments. Applications can direct SELECT queries to a replica endpoint while write operations continue to use the primary database.

**Conceptual Note:**  
No specific SQL command is used here; rather, itâ€™s about configuring your connection strings and database settings to point to a replica.

---

## 38. User-Defined Aggregate Functions (UDAFs)  
**Purpose:**  
Create custom aggregate functions to perform specialized summarizations that built-in functions might not cover.

**Example (Conceptual - PostgreSQL):**  
```sql
-- In PostgreSQL, you can define a custom aggregate function.
-- This example assumes you have created a supporting state function 'numeric_avg' to calculate the average.
CREATE AGGREGATE custom_avg(numeric) (
  sfunc = numeric_avg,  -- state function to process each value
  stype = numeric,      -- state data type
  initcond = '0'
);
```

*Note: Syntax and capabilities vary by database. SQL Server, for example, supports UDAFs via CLR integration.*

---

## 39. Column-Level Encryption  
**Purpose:**  
Enhance data security by encrypting sensitive data stored in specific columns. This protects data at rest and limits exposure if unauthorized access occurs.

**Example (SQL Server using symmetric key encryption):**  
```sql
-- First, open the symmetric key (configured previously with a certificate)
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY MyKey DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE MyCert;

-- Encrypt the SSN column for a specific customer
UPDATE Customers 
SET EncryptedSSN = ENCRYPTBYKEY(KEY_GUID('MyKey'), SSN)
WHERE CustomerID = 123;
```

*This example encrypts the `SSN` field into a new column `EncryptedSSN`. Decryption would use the corresponding DECRYPTBYKEY function.*

---

## 40. Approximate Query Processing  
**Purpose:**  
Quickly run aggregations over massive datasets by returning approximate results with a known error margin. This is useful when speed is more critical than exact precision.

**Example (SQL Server / BigQuery):**  
```sql
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(UserID) AS ApproxUserCount
FROM Logins;
```

*This query calculates an approximate distinct count of users, often much faster than an exact count on very large tables.*
