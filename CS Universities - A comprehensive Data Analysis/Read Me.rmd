Project Title: Unraveling Excellence: A Data-Driven Analysis of Computer Science Universities

Introduction:
This project presents a comprehensive data-driven exploration of Computer Science (CS) universities worldwide. 
Leveraging a carefully curated dataset sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for open datasets, 
we delve into key attributes such as rankings, academic reputation, employer reputation, and research impact to uncover insights 
into the factors contributing to academic excellence.

Data Source and Preparation:
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, underwent meticulous preparation through the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process using Excel Power Query. 
This ensured data consistency and uniformity before importing it into a SQL database, setting the stage for rigorous exploratory data analysis.

About the data:
The data dictionary will help you understand about the data, the dataset contains over 2400 universities that are being observed over the years on the basis of various
variables such as index citations, international research, academic reputation etc, which contributes to the overall score. I have tried to connect these scores to 
provide an holisitic view into how these universities help mold a computer science student who would enroll into the college in perspective of science, technology and 
research.
The uncleaned data has been given for you to follow along, you are  free to copy every query in the file, but I would suggest to make a few changes and brainstorm a couple
of unique business problems that you would want to search the answers for.


Exploration Process:

    1. Data Familiarization: A comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and variables paved the way for relevant questions and hypotheses.

    2. Descriptive Statistics: Basic statistics offered insights into the distribution and spread of key attributes.

    3. Top Performers: Identifying universities with the highest CS_Overall_Score unveiled leading institutions.

    4. Country-wise Analysis: Segmenting data by countries revealed patterns and disparities across different nations.

    5. Correlation Analysis: Investigating the relationship between CS_Academic_Reputation and CS_Employer_Reputation unveiled potential links between academic acclaim and employability.

    6. Cluster Analysis: Utilizing clustering algorithms, universities were categorized based on CS_Employer_Reputation and CS_Citations_Per_Paper to identify research and industry collaboration prospects.

    7. Temporal Trends: Long-term analysis of top 10 universities' CS_Overall_Scores provided implications for academic commitment decisions.

    8. Comparative Analysis: Contrasting CS_Academic_Reputation and CS_Index_Citations scores highlighted institutions emphasizing research impact.

    9. Hypothesis Testing: Testing for significant differences in CS_Overall_Score between universities in the United States and other countries provided valuable insights.

    10. Educational Insights: The project culminated in data-backed recommendations for prospective CS students, emphasizing high employability countries and potential relocation options for academic pursuits.

Conclusion:
Through meticulous data analysis and SQL, this project has illuminated the landscape of CS universities,
offering valuable insights into academic excellence, trends, and opportunities. 
These findings provide a solid foundation for informed decision-making and better understanding the attributes driving success in the world of Computer Science education.
