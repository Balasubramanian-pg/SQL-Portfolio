## 1.1 Business Definition Artefacts

### What must be created and why

These artefacts lock the **problem framing and analytical intent** before any data model or dashboard exists. Without these, every downstream metric becomes debatable.

### 1. Business Problem Statement

Purpose
Formally defines the business question the platform exists to answer.

Content to include

* Why marketing effectiveness is currently mismeasured
* Financial risk of relying on proxy metrics
* Exact question being answered: incremental impact on sales

Output

* 1 to 2 page written document
* Audience: leadership, finance, marketing

---

### 2. Analytical Objective Statement

Purpose
Defines what analytical success looks like, independent of tooling.

Content to include

* Separation of baseline vs actual performance
* Lift as an absolute incremental measure, not a ratio
* Requirement for explainability and auditability

Output

* Single-page objective charter
* Signed off by business and analytics owners

---

### 3. In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope Definition

Purpose
Prevents scope creep and protects analytical rigor.

Content to include
In Scope

* Market lift computation
* Campaign impact measurement
* Cross-geo and cross-product analysis

Out of Scope

* Real-time optimization
* Customer-level attribution
* Predictive marketing automation

Output

* Scope boundary document
* Referenced in all future change requests

---

### 4. Stakeholder Responsibility Matrix

Purpose
Clarifies ownership and accountability.

Content to include

* Commercial leadership: decision ownership
* Marketing: campaign metadata ownership
* Finance: revenue validation
* Data engineering: pipeline and model ownership
* BI: consumption and visualization

Output

* RACI-style matrix
* Required for governance sign-off

---

### 5. Campaign Evaluation Principles

Purpose
Sets non-negotiable analytical rules.

Content to include

* Marketing creates incremental sales only
* Not all sales during campaign windows are attributable
* Negative lift is valid and actionable
* Comparisons require consistent baselines

Output

* Principles document
* Used in executive reviews to prevent misuse

---

### 6. Lift Interpretation Guidelines for Leadership

Purpose
Prevents misreading and misuse of lift metrics.

Content to include

* How to read baseline vs actual
* When negative lift is expected
