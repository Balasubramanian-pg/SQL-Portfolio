# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to identify the rows in the Products table where both the `low_fats` and `recyclable` columns have a value of 'Y'. This means we are looking for products that meet two conditions simultaneously.

# Approach
Our approach will be to use a SQL query with a WHERE clause to filter the rows based on the conditions. We will select the `product_id` column from the Products table where `low_fats` is 'Y' and `recyclable` is 'Y'. This will give us the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ 

# Code
```mysql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
