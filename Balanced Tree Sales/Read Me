## Balanced Tree Clothing Company: Sales Analysis

Balanced Tree Clothing Company, a leading provider of stylish and functional clothing for modern adventurers, seeks your expertise in analyzing their sales performance. Danny, the CEO, has entrusted you with assisting the merchandising teams in generating a comprehensive sales report for the wider business.

This report will be based on two key datasets from Balanced Tree's database:

* **product_details:** This table holds detailed information about all the clothing and lifestyle items offered by Balanced Tree.
* **sales:** This table captures sales data for each product, including quantity sold, transaction details, and potentially pricing information.

**Additional Datasets (Bonus Challenge):**

The case study also includes two bonus tables:

* **product_hierarchy:** This table may reveal product categorization or relationships within Balanced Tree's inventory.
* **product_prices:** This table might provide historical or dynamic pricing information for each product.

These bonus tables will be utilized for a separate challenge question.

**Next Steps:**

To best understand Balanced Tree's sales performance and create a valuable report, we will need to visualize the relationships between these datasets through an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This diagram will act as a roadmap for analyzing the data and extracting meaningful insights.

This revised introduction clarifies the purpose, simplifies technical jargon, and emphasizes the importance of the ERD for further analysis.
